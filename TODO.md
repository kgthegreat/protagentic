# Protagentic TODO - Next Steps and Missing Features

## Critical Issues to Address

### 1. Context Continuity Between Steps ❌
**Current State**: Each step (requirements → design → tasks → code generation) operates independently without passing context from previous steps.

**Problem**: 
- Code generation doesn't know about existing project files
- No awareness of previously generated code when executing subsequent tasks
- Each task execution is isolated, leading to potential conflicts and inconsistencies

**Required Implementation**:
- [ ] Modify `protagentic-executor--build-execution-context` to include all previously generated files
- [ ] Add project file scanning to detect existing codebase structure
- [ ] Pass complete project context (existing files, generated files, dependencies) to LLM prompts
- [ ] Implement incremental code generation that builds upon previous outputs
- [ ] Add conflict detection when generating files that might overwrite existing code

### 2. Cost Optimization and Display ❌
**Current State**: Cost tracking exists but is not optimized or prominently displayed.

**Problems**:
- No real-time cost display during operations
- Token usage is estimated, not actual
- No cost breakdown by operation type
- No cost optimization strategies implemented

**Required Implementation**:
- [ ] Real-time cost display in modeline or dedicated buffer

## Verification Checklist

### Context Continuity Issues ❌
- **Does each step take care that files generated in previous steps are updated?**

  - No, only requirements/design content is passed, not generated files

### Cost Management Issues ❌
- **Is cost optimized?** 
  - No, prompts are not optimized for token efficiency
- **Is cost shown to users?** 
  - Minimal cost display, no real-time tracking

### Feature Gaps Compared to Kiro ❌
- **Chat window like Kiro?** - No
- **File system access?** - Limited to file generation
- **Terminal access?** - No
- **Command execution?** - No
- **Real-time interaction?** - No
- **Multiple LLM providers?** - No, only OpenAI

This TODO represents a comprehensive roadmap to transform Protagentic from a spec generation tool into a full-featured AI development assistant comparable to Kiro.
